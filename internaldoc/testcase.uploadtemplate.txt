This script describes steps to test the use of the add template anytime facility
and codes ability to create OU wikis from that template. It assumes that the tt server
is set up so has to allow the Roll Forward of dummy courses.

The script also tests the embedding of files and attachments into templates.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'wiki' always refers to the OU wiki.

The test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent,
except as noted.
